        <h2>What is Spaced Revision?</h2>
        <p>Spaced revision, also known as spaced repetition or spaced learning, is a learning technique that involves reviewing and revisiting material over spaced intervals of time. This method is based on the psychological principle that information is better retained in long-term memory when it is reviewed and reinforced at increasing intervals.</p>

        <h2>How Spaced Revision Works</h2>
        <p>The spaced revision technique works by breaking down your study sessions into shorter, repeated intervals. Instead of cramming all at once, you revisit the material at specific intervals, gradually increasing the time between each review session. This approach helps strengthen memory recall and enhances long-term retention.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Spaced Revision</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved long-term retention of information.</li>
            <li>Efficient use of study time.</li>
            <li>Reduced likelihood of forgetting important concepts.</li>
            <li>Enhanced comprehension and mastery of subjects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Get Started with Spaced Revision</h2>
        <p>If you want to improve your learning and retention, consider incorporating spaced revision into your study routine. Start by creating a study schedule that includes regular review sessions for the material you're learning. There are also various digital tools and apps available that can help you implement spaced repetition in your study plan.</p>
